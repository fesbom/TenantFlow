## Overview

This is a multi-tenant dental clinic management system designed as an MVP for small dental practices. The application provides comprehensive practice management features including patient records, appointment scheduling, medical records, anamnesis questionnaires, and budget management. Each clinic operates as an isolated tenant with role-based access control for administrators, dentists, and secretaries.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management with custom hooks for authentication
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation schemas

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js REST API
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control middleware
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling image uploads with local storage
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints organized by resource (patients, appointments, medical records, etc.)

### Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Multi-tenancy**: Clinic-based isolation using `clinic_id` foreign keys across all tenant data tables
- **Schema**: Comprehensive relational design covering clinics, users, patients, appointments, medical records, anamnesis, and budgets
- **Migration**: Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Strategy**: JWT tokens stored in localStorage with automatic header injection
- **Roles**: Three-tier system (admin, dentist, secretary) with route-level permissions
- **Security**: Password hashing with bcryptjs and middleware-based route protection
- **Multi-tenant**: Clinic-scoped access control ensuring data isolation

### Component Architecture
- **Layout**: Responsive sidebar navigation with role-based menu filtering
- **Modals**: Reusable modal components for CRUD operations
- **Forms**: Standardized form patterns with validation and error handling
- **Tables**: Consistent data presentation with search, filtering, and actions

### Data Flow
- **Client-Server**: React Query handles caching, synchronization, and optimistic updates
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error boundaries with toast notifications
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading indicators across all data operations

## Recent Changes

### Patient Photo Management (October 2025)

#### Photo Upload Infrastructure
- **Database**: Added `photoUrl` column to patients table (TEXT, optional)
- **Backend Endpoint**: `POST /api/patients/:id/photo` for photo uploads
  - Validates file type (JPG, PNG, WEBP)
  - Validates file size (max 5MB)
  - Uses multer for file handling
  - Stores files in local file system
- **Dependencies**: Installed `react-cropper` and `cropperjs` for image cropping

#### PhotoUpload Component
- **Upload Methods**:
  - File upload from device
  - Webcam capture with live preview
- **Image Editing**:
  - Cropping with 4:3 aspect ratio
  - Canvas-based processing at 800x600 resolution
  - JPEG output with 0.9 quality
- **Features**:
  - Photo removal functionality
  - Client-side validation (type, size)
  - Error handling with user feedback via toasts
  - Async blob conversion for proper error catching
- **Integration**: Embedded in patient modal form

#### Photo Display Locations
- **Patient List**: 40x40px circular thumbnail next to patient name with User icon fallback
- **Calendar Events**: 20x20px miniature in event component alongside patient name
- **Dashboard Birthdays**: 40x40px photo with pink border and cake badge overlay in corner
- **Medical Records Modal**: 64x64px photo in patient info header section
- All displays include appropriate test IDs and graceful fallbacks when no photo exists

### Dashboard Birthday Timezone Fix (October 2025)

#### Bug Description
The dashboard birthday list was displaying patients whose birthdays are tomorrow instead of today, due to timezone differences between the server (UTC) and Brazilian clinics (America/Sao_Paulo timezone).

#### Solution Implementation
- **Database-Level Timezone Handling**: All date comparison logic moved to PostgreSQL using `NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'America/Sao_Paulo'`
- **server/storage.ts Changes**:
  - Added `PaginatedResponse<T>` interface for typed paginated responses
  - Updated `getBirthdayPatients` signature to accept pagination parameters instead of date
  - SQL query uses `EXTRACT(MONTH/DAY FROM birthDate)` compared against localized timestamp
  - Returns paginated results with metadata (page, pageSize, totalCount, totalPages)
- **server/routes.ts Changes**:
  - Route `GET /api/dashboard/birthday-patients` extracts pagination from query parameters
  - Removed JavaScript-based date logic
  - Delegates all timezone handling to database layer
- **Result**: Birthday matching now correctly uses SÃ£o Paulo local time, ensuring patients are shown on their actual birthday regardless of server timezone

### Appointment Scheduling Enhancements (October 2025)

#### Default Appointment Duration per Dentist
- Added `defaultAppointmentDuration` field to users table (optional, in minutes)
- User form displays duration input when role is "dentist"
- Appointment modal auto-fills duration when dentist is selected (fallback to 60 minutes)
- Backend route: `PUT /api/users/:id` to update user preferences

#### Flexible Appointment Duration
- **Calendar Configuration**: 10-minute intervals (step=10, timeslots=6) for better granularity
- **Frontend Validation**:
  - Minimum: 5 minutes
  - Maximum: Calculated dynamically to midnight (allows appointments ending exactly at 00:00)
  - No fixed step restrictions - users can input any duration value
- **Backend Validation**:
  - POST/PUT `/api/appointments` validates duration bounds
  - Uses `setHours(24,0,0,0)` with `Math.ceil` for accurate midnight boundary calculation
  - Prevents appointments from extending beyond midnight with appropriate error messages
- **Bug Fix**: Corrected midnight boundary calculation to allow appointments ending at exactly 00:00 (previously blocked at 23:59)
